# SQUARED ERROR CRITERION

## weighted least squares

measuremnts from different sensors, some better than others

y = Hx + v

ordinary LS assumes noise term has equal variance

Weight LS : assume noise is independent but of different variance

noise covariance
e = loss function, error term
LSw = eTR^e
= e^\_1/sigma^\_1 + e^\_2/sigma^\_2 + e^\_3/sigma^\_3...

e = Y - Hx

lower variance measurements have higher weights

if LWs as above has equal sigmas (variance/standard deviation) then it reduces to ordinary least squares

Method: weighted average of masurements
