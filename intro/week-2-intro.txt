Sensors and Computing Hardware

Sensors for Perception
    computing Hardware
    design
    sw architecture
    environment representation

Sensor types
    device measures or detects environment property or changes
    exteroceptive = surroundings
    proprioceptive = internal

exteroceptive 
-------------
Camera 
    metrics
        resolution 
        FOV
        dynamic range
    tradeoff FOV vs resolution
    stereo camera - depth estimation

LIDAR
    3d scene geometry
    point cloud map
    metrics
        number of beams
        points per second
        rotation rate
        detection range
        FOV
    HD solid state LIDAR coming soon        

RADAR
    object detection
    speed estimatino
    metrics 
        WFOV short range
        NFOV long range

SONAR
    low cost
    short range all weather
    independent of lighting


proprioceptive 
--------------

GNSS
    position
    velocity
    RTK,PPP,DGPS

IMU
    acceleration
    rotation rates

Odometry
    speed accuracy


Computing Hardware
------------------

main computer(s)
    receives sensor data
    computes actions

image processing
    GPU
    FPGA
    ASICS

Synchronization
    common clock
    GPS timing (1 hz pulse)
