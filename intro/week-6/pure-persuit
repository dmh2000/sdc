Pure Pursuit - Geometric
------------------------

any controller that tracks a reference path
using geometry and kinematics

lateral controller that ignores lateral forces

relies on kinematic model

downside : performance suffers for agressive maneuvers

works well in linear tire region

uses reference point on path to measure error 
    Lookahead point

controller:
    reference point is placed on path  at fixed distance
    steer to intercept ; constant angle
    point moves forward
    steering angle reduces
    Ld = lookahead line = center of rear axie to target point
    alpha = angle between heading and Ld
    instanenous center of rotation 
        triangle
            rear axle to Ld
            R 
            R 
            angle between RR is 2 alpha

    Ld / sin * salpha = R / sin(pi/2-alpha)
    Ld / (s sin alpha cos alpha) = R /cos alpha
    Ld / sin alpha = 2R
    Kappa = 1 / R = 2 sin alpha / Ld

    example
    Ld = 4m
    

steering angle 
    K = 2 sin alpha / Ld
    delta = arctan KL
    delta = arctan (2L sin alpha / Ld)    

Crosstrack error (E)
    lateral distance between heading vector and target point 
    sin alpha = E / Ld
    K = 2 sin alpha / Ld = (2 / Ld^2) * e
    similar to proportional controller
    Proportaional gain 2 / Ld^2 tuned for different speeds
    adjust Ld based on speed : linear
        Ld = KppVf
        delta = arctan(2L sin alpha / Ld) 
        Kappa = (2/Ld^2) * error
        delta = arctan( (2L sin alpha) / (Kdd * Vf))
        lookahead is further ahead based on speed
