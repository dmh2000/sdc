use front axle as a reference point
    global convergence
    predictable decay

steering law
    correct heading error
    correct cross track error
    steering limits
    no lookahead but directly at reference point

e = relative to front axle
delta = sterring agnle
psi = heading error
Vf = front wheel velocity

1. steer to align heading with desired heading  delta = psi
2. steer to eliminate cross track error 
    proportional to error 
    inversely proportional to speed
    limit effect of large errors with arctan
    gain k determined experimentally
        delta = arctan(K*e/Vf)
3. delta with min/max

control law : 
    delta = psi + arctan(Ke/Vf), delta = [min,max]
    large heading errors, steer in opposite direction to get within bounds
        psi becomes large
    large crosstrack, steer toward reference point scaled by speed
        arctan(K*e/Vf) becomes large ~ pi/2

    as heading changes due to steering agnle
    heading correction counteracts crosstrack correction, and drives
    the angle back to zero
    
crosstrack error dynamics when not a max angle:
    e_dot = -Vf * sin(psi) - delta = -Vf sin(arctan(ke/vf))
          = -K*e / sqrt(1 + (K*d)/Vf)^2)
    for small crosstrack error leads to exponential decay   e_dot ~ -k * e


low speed adjustments
    inverse speed numerical instability
        Vf in denominator nears zero causes blow up
    add softening constant to
    delta = psi + atan(Ke / (Ks + Vf))
higher speeds - stanley is over agressive
    extra damping on heading
    PD Controller
constant radius curve
    add feedforward
