Model-Predictive Controller
---------------------------

numerically solve optimization at each time step
receding horizon control - actuator signal based on fixed horizon 

advantages
    straightfoward : objective function and constraints
    explicitly handles constraints
    works for linear or nonlinear

disadvantages
    computationally expensive

Receding horizon
    current time to end of time horizon 
        objects, constraints
    state may change during computation
        set initial state to predicted state
    
    pick horizon length
    T = receding horizon length and time step t
    x(t) = predicted state x
        set initial state to predicted state
        perform optimization over fine horizon t to T 
        while traveling from X(t-1) to X(t)
        apply first ccontrol command Up from optimization at time time

                                    cost/constraints          past inputs/states

    ref trajectory (+) fugure error -> Optimizer -> current input -> Model => predicted outputs/states
