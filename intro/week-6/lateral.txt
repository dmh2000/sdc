Lateral Control Intro
----------------------

lateral control - precisely follow a path with steering angle
    error relative to path
    control design drives errors to zero within angle limits
    dyanamic considerations for forces and moments

reference path
    straight line segments
        depends on environment
        discontinuities at changes
    waypoints 
        divide path into waypoints
    parameterized curves
        fixed set 
        optimized during planning
        continous, smooth derivatives 
    Goals
        heading path alignment
        eliminate offset to path

point ordering
curve ordering

Geometric controllers - geometry and kinematics
    pure pursuit

Dynamic Controllers -
    model-predictive-controller - MPC
    optimized solutions
    others
        sliding model
        feedback linearization

Plan Model - bicycle
    states and inputs defined relative to center of front axle
    solid line is reference path
    dotted line parallel thru front axle
    heading = relative to current path line segment
    v = front wheel speed
    d = steering relative to heading
    psi = heading relative to trajectory
    front axle, cg, rear axle

    heading errors
        front axle : psi_dot_desired (0) - psi_dot = Vf * sin delta / L (wheelbase)
                    desired is 0 for straight line segments
                    psi_dot = -Vf *sin(delta) / L
    crosstrack error : e
        distance front axle to closet point on path
        rate of change = lateral component of velocity
        e_dot = Vf * sin(psi - delta)
        curved path - harder to determine reference point
