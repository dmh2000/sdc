Tire Slip and Modeling
----------------------

Slip Angle Beta
    angle between forward direction and actual direction
    alpha = arctan(Vy/Vx) = arctan(y_dot/x_dot)
    small angle approximation
    alpha = y_dot / x_dot
tire slip angle 
    angle between direction pointing and direction traveling
    alpha_xr = -Beta + Lr*psi_dot/V
    alpha_xf = detla - Beta - (Lf*psi_dot)/V


Slip Ratio
    longitudinal slip
    W = wheel angular speed
    Re = effective radius
    V = forward velocity
    S = (W * Re - V)/V

    tire sliding
    when WRe < V -> wheels are skidding during decel 
    when WRe > V -> wheels are spinning
    When WRe = 0 -> wheels are locked
