Lateral Dynamics

Rotation Rate of vehicle

longitudinal velocity is constant
left and right axel are lumped into a single wheel
suspension,road incline and aero are neglected

lateral Dynamics
CG is centerpoint

lateral acceleration
Ay = Y_dot_ot + omega^2 * R
   = V*beta_dot + V * psi_dot

V = omega * R = vehicle velocity
omega = psi_dot
beta_dot = slip angle rate of change = side slip rate
psi_dot = heading rate of change = yaw rate
Fy = tire forces
Iz = vehicle inertia
Lf and Ly = CG to tire distance

lateral dynamics
mV * (beta_dot + psi_dot) = Fyf + Fyr

angular acceleration
Iz * psi_dot_dot = Lf Fyf - LrFyr

tire slip models
for small angles -> linear approximation
alpha_f = front tire side slip angle
alpha_r = rear tire slip angle
Cy = cornering stiffness = resist deformation  
Beta = vehicle slip angle
delta = steering angle

linearized cornering stiffness approximation
Fyf = Cf*alpha_f = Cf (delta - Beta - Lf*psi_dot/V)
Fyr = Cr*alpha_r = Cf (-Beta + Lf*psi_dot/V)

State Space Representation
Xlat = [y Beta psi psi_dot]
Xlat+1 = Alat * Xlat + Blat*delta
