Dynamic Modeling 2D
--------------------

no-slip condition does not apply
forces : drag, road friction, drive train

define coordinate frames
    body
    inertial
lumped dynamic elemenets
free body diagram
dynamic equations

SUM F = m*a
SUM T = l*a

rolling cart 
x = position 
m = mass of cart 
f1 = right 
f2 = left 
f3 = left
Ma = Sum f
Mx_dot_dot = f1 - f2 - f3

shock absorber spring and flow 
y = position
m = mass
k = spring constant
b = damping coefficient
F = My-dot-dot + b * y_dot + ky


Rotational

Tau = torque

theta = angular position
tire inertia = j = mass
stiffness = k
damping = b 

t_drive
t_load
theta's 

J*theta_dot_dot + b * theta_dot + k*theta = T_drive - T_load
