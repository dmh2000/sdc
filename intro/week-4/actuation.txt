Vehicle Acutation

steering,throttle,braking
connect to longitudinal and lateral models

Inputs
steering 
    -> lateral dynamics 
    -> lateral forces 
    -> lateral kinematics 
    -> yaw rate
throttle/brake 
    -> longitudinal dynamics 
    -> longitudinal forces 
    -> longitudinal kinematics 
    -> forward velocity 

lateral and longitudinal dynamics and kinematics are coupled

control task : keep steering,throttle,brake to keep vehicle on
    desired path and speed from motion planner

Steering 
--------
turn command -> wheel angle -> lateral forces

C = steering gear ratio
steering angle = delta_s
wheel angle = delta = C*delta_s

Power Train 
-----------

Commands
    Throttle
    Brake 

transmission   
    gears 1 and 2 are 'torque mode'
    higher gears are 'speed mode'

throttle 
    -> engine
    -> torque converter
    -> transmission
    -> differential
    -> brakes
    -> wheels

Acceleration
------------ 
throttle 
    -> engine 
    -> transmission 
    -> wheel torque 

accel model different 
    gas engine 
        peak torque in middle rpms
        torque falls off at low and high rpms
    diesel engine 
        more consistent torqure over RPM range
    electric
        constant torque at low rpm
        falls off at higher rpm (constant power) 
    
gas engine model
    X_theta = throttle position %
    omega_e = engine angular rate (rpm)
    A0,A1,A2 are tuning parameters
    Temax(omega_e) = A0 + A1omega_e + A2omega_e^2
    Te(omegaE,X_theta) = X_theta  * (a0 + A1omega_e + A2omega_e^2)


Braking 
-------

brake pressure -> disk force -> wheel torque
delta_P = brake pressure
Tbrake = k * delta_P

brake functionality
    shorten stopping distance
    steerability during braking wit ABS
    stability during braking to avoid overturning
