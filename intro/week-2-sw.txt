Software Architecture

Environment  Perception
-----------------------
Sensors + Environment Mapping => location and classify
GPS/IMU/Odometry => Localization => position
Camera + LIDAR   => Dynamic Object Detection 
                 => bounding boxes 
                 => Dynamic Object Tracking 
                 => Object Prediction 
Camera + LIDAR   => Static objects

Environment Mapping
-----------------------
Sensors => map 
Object Tracks + sensors => Occupancy Grid Map
Object Tracks + sensors => Localization Map
apriori + Perception + segemnted image + static objects
    => Detailed Road Map 

Motion Planning
-----------------------
Environment Perception => planned path
    Mission Planner => optimal sequence
    OccupancyGrid + Dynamic Objects + position
        => Behavior Planner => determine safe actions
    Occupancy Grid + Position + Dynamic Objects 
        =>  Local Planner => trajectory

Controller
-----------------------
Motion Planning => controller => actuators 
Position + trajectory =>
    Velocity Controller
    Steering Controller

System Supervisor
-----------------------

Software Supervisor
    validate software elements
Hardware Supervisor
    sensors
    actuators


Environment Representation
--------------------------

Map Types

Localization Map
    localization point cloud or feature map
    LIDAR

Occupancy Grid Map  
    fine grained grid map 2d or 3d
    keep only viable cells, remove others
    non-interfering static objects are removed from grid
    dynamic objects are removed

Detailed Road Map
    apriori data
    lanes
    regulations
    online (rare, too network intensive)
    offline (detailed but can be out of date)
    offline + updated online (best)
    path planning
