taxonomy of Self Driving Cars

Dynamic Driving Task (DDT)
    perception
    planning
    control

Operational Design Domain (ODD)
    driver attention
    driver action
    driving task capabilities
        lateral control
        longitudinal control
        object event detect response (OEDR)
        planning
            long term
            short term
            immediate
    fallback

Levels 
------

level 0 - no automation
level 1 - driver assist
    lateral OR longitudinal 
    adaptive cruise
    lane keeping
    driver monitoring and assists

level 2 - Partial Driving Automation
    lateral AND longitudinal 
    driver monitoring and assists

level 3 Conditional Driving Automation
    lateral AND longitudinal with OEDR
    less driver attention
    alerts
    
level 4 High Driving Automation
    passenger rather than driver, may or may not intervene
    full DDT automation within limiited ODD
    requests to intervene
    performs fallback 
    minimal risk Conditional

level 4 High Driving Automation
    passenger rather than driver, may or may not intervene
    full DDT automation within unlimiited ODD (drivable)
    requests to intervene
    performs fallback 
    minimal risk Conditional

Perception 
----------

requirements
    perceive -> plan 
    OEDR required
    identify -> predict -> plan

informed decisions
    static elements
        roads
        signs
        curbs
        signals
    dynamic elements
        vehicles (2w and 4w)
        pedestrians

Localization - where am I 
    GPS
    IMU
    Odometry

detection/segmentation
    machine learning 
    training data 
    expensive

sensor limitations
    uncertainty
    occlusion/reflection
    illumination/lens flare (redundancy)
    weather/recipitation

KITTI Vision Benchmark Suite

Decisions - Actions

    planning - reactive or predictive 

    long term - mission plan
    short term - lane change, intersection 
    immediate - track and speed

reactive planning   
    rule based, current state, no prediction

predictive planning 
    prediction based
    accuracy of predictions
