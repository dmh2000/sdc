Highway vs Urban  

camera,radar,lidar,sonar,gnss/imu/odometry

deceleration rates
    aggressive 5m/s^2
    comfortable 2m/s^2
    stopping distance d = v^2/2a
        v = velocity
        a = deceleration rates

Where to place sensors
    within the ODD

Highway Maneuvers

    emergency stop 
        110 meters with aggressive deceleration
        150-200 meters
        adjacent lane
    maintain speed
        relative < 30 kph
        100 meters
        current lane
        adjacent lane
        2 seconds
    lane change
        forward
        behind
        more lateral coverage
    coverage requirements
        emergency stop
        emergency stop - maintain speed
        maintain speed - lane change
        lane change

Urban Maneuvers

    emergency stop
    maintain speed
    lane change
    overtaking
        longitudinal
        lateral beyond adjacent lanes
    turning/crossing
        omnidirectional sensors
    roundabouts
