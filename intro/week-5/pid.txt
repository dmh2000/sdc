PID CONTROLL
------------

LTI - linear time invariant control 

plant or process model
    system represention
        linear or nonlinear
        plan : state space and transfer function
        LTI system can be expressed using transfer functions 

Transfer Function 
    G is a relation between input U and output Y
    Y(s) = G(s)U(s) = (N(s)/D(s)) * U(s)  (complex variable)
    s = sigma + j*omega
    transfer function go from time domain to s domain 
        easier analysis and performance
    Zeros : roots of N  
    Poles : roots of D

Control Algorithm Design
    simple  
        lead-lag
        PID
    complex
        feedback linearization
        backstepping
        sliding model
    optimization
        model predictive control

PID control
    u(t) = Kpe(t) + Ki(integral of error) + Kd(derivative of error)
    Kp,Ki,Kd are gains

Lapace Domain
    U(s) = Gc(s)E(s) = (kp + Ki/s + Kd*s) * E(s)
         = ((Kd*s^2 + Kp*s + Ki) * E(s)
           --------------------
                  S

    Gc(s)= ((Kd*s^2 + Kp*s + Ki)
           --------------------
                  S
    PID has single pole at the origin (s, integral term)
    two zeros placed anywhere
    tuning is moving the zeros
    Zeigler-Nichols for tuning

Closed Loop Respone for step input
    step input-> rise time   = time to 90% of reference value
                 overshoot   = max % exceeding reference
                 settle time = time to settle to 5% of reference
                 steady state = error between output and reference

Second Order Spring-Mass system

dynamics -> m*x_dot_dot + b*x_dot + k*x = F x(0) = 0
    m = Mass
    b = damping coefficient
    k = spring constant 

Laplace Transform
M*s^2*X(s) + b*s*X(s) + k*X(s) = F(s)

Plant Transfer Function
G(s) = X(S)/F(S) = 1/(m*s^2 + b*s + k)

Open Loop Step Response
-----------------------
m = 1, b=10,k=20,F=1

Closed Loop Transfer Function
-----------------------------
G(s) = plant process
Gc(s) = controller
H(s) = sensor/estimators

Y(s)/R(s) = G(s)*Gc(s)
            ----------
            1 + G(s)Gc(s)
